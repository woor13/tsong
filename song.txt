Come my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby
Come my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly

Sugar babySuch a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce
You got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cos your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side
There's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill
Time is passing

And yo, what's happening now?
I see the sun breaking
Shining through dark clouds
And a vision of you
Standing out in the crowdsCome my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby

Come my lady
You're my pretty baby
Yo I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazyCome my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby
