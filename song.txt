Come my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly
Sugar baby
Come my lady
Come, come my lady
You're my butterfly

Sugar babySuch a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce
You got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cos your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side
There's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill
Time is passing
